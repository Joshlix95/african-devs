# african-devs

A directory of great developers in Africa!

## Rationale

I'm a student from Nigeria currently studying in the US. As much as I'd like not to be, I'm a bit removed from the tech scene back home in Nigeria and in Africa. I've recently started following some designers + devs from Nigeria. I'd love to know more about designers and devs around the continent. If there are enough names we can start grouping them country by country or region by region. I modeled this closely after https://github.com/iheanyi/speakers-who-want-a-platform.

I don't want to argue about anyone's identity but I'm creating this list so I can keep up with the tech scene back home. If you identify as a developer in Africa - living somewhere on the continent, developing a product for a country (or countries) in the continent - please consider adding yourself! Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines for contributing.
